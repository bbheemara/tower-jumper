Tower Jumper 🏰
A physics-based vertical platformer where you control a character climbing an endless tower filled with hazards, powerups, and dynamic platforms.

Description
Tower Jumper is a vertical-scrolling platformer built using Python and Pygame. Players must ascend an infinite tower by jumping from platform to platform while avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. The higher you climb, the more difficult the tower becomes, introducing environmental effects like earthquakes and wind gusts.

Features 🎯

Smooth player animations with directional walking and jumping

Multiple platform types: static, moving, bouncing, and breaking

Randomized power-ups: wings, double jump, magnet, slow time

Dynamic tower effects: earthquakes (shake platforms) and wind (push player)

Hazards: flying birds, spikes, falling rocks

Height-based scoring with local high score tracking

Game over screen with restart option

Visual indicators for active power-ups

Procedural platform and hazard generation
